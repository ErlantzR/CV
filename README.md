## Erlantz Ramos

I am a self-driven and fast learner person, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also continue my development as a software developer.

With a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering, I have always had some interest in programming. Started a Computer Science degree while working part-time for some time and recently learnt to code at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp, so I could finally start my career path in Software

Tech Skills: Ruby
