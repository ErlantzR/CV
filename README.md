## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a self-driven and quick learner full stack programmer, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also continue my development as a software developer.

I studied Industrial Engineering, with specialisation in Production, but I have always had interest in programming. Started a Computer Science degree while working part-time in London for some time and recently decided to give it my full time attention by joining Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp, so I could finally start my career path in Software.

Tech Skills:
- JavaScript (React, Node.js, Express, Jest, Cypress)
- Ruby (Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara) 
- Databases (MongoDB, SQL: PostgreSQL)
- HTML, CSS
- Heroku
- Git, GitHub

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

### Quick learner

During my working life, I have expereienced several times where this skill (quick learner) has been needed and beneficial. Even though my specialization is in Production Engineer, I have joined 2 companies in London where my role had no relation with that and I had to quickly learn all what was needed to perform as expected.  
At Qila, a company dedicated to Biogas, I had to learn all about the process of getting energy from Biogas and design of AD (Anaerobic Digestion) Plants, so I could provide the right support to operators and director.  
At Overview, a company dedicated to positioning drives, I had to understand the elctronic and software used on the drives they sell, so I could provide support to clients or internally about what the drives were capable to do.  
In both situations, I have been told good things about my performance and my flexibility in terms of learning new concepts.


### Self-driven

When working at Overview, my role implied being in contact  with future and current clients who were using our products (or testing them) for a particular project. After a few months, my manager resigned and I became the only point of contact with clients for this purpose.  
Being a self-driven, self-motivated individual helped me during this process. Of course I needed some help sometimes from some of my colleagues in other teams but I wasn't afraid to ask so I could own my role and the company decided to let me as the contact from clients for applications (they never replaced my old manager's position).

### Team player

Even though I am also used to work on my own, I believe in the importance on working in a team and have good communication with others.  
During my work experience in both Qila and Overview, I had to collaborate with other colleagues to achieve the right answers or outcomes. Also, before that, I work in Marks and Spencer, firs as Team Member and then as Team Lead, where being able to work in a team was crucial and had good experiences there (both being part of the team and leading).  
Besides, during these last few months at Makers, we focussed on the way Software teams usually work. We had pairing sessions everyday and got involved in engineering projects, where, as part of a small team (between 5 and 7 people), we had to develop a project. In these situations I exoerienced how important a good organization and good communication are when working in a team.

### Critical thinking

I have always considered I am good on critical thinking, which has helped me both when studying my degree in Engineering and during Makers bootcamp.  
Besides, it is a skill that became important during my work experinence. I remember, for example, this time at Overview when I was in contact with clients resolving doubts they might have about our products and I realised some of these questions were the same from time to time, so I decided to create a register with these questions from clients to reflect whether there were some that were constantly received. The intention was to point out to some lack of information on the manuals we sent to customer or parts that could need a better explanation. This led to updates in the manuals which improved our relationship with clients.
