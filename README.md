## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a self-driven and quick learner individual, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also continue my development as a software developer.

I studied Industrial Engineering, with specialisation in Production, but I have always had interest in programming. Started a Computer Science degree while working part-time in London for some time and recently decided to give it my full time attention by joining Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp, so I could finally start my career path in Software.

Tech Skills:
- JavaScript (React, Node.js, Express, Jest, Cypress)
- Ruby (Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara) 
- Databases (MongoDB, SQL: PostgreSQL)
- HTML, CSS
- Heroku
- Git, GitHub

<!--Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result? -->


### Quick learner

During my working life, I have expereienced several times where this skill (quick learner) has been needed and beneficial. Even though my specialization is in Production Engineer, I have joined 2 companies in London where my role had no relation with that and I had to quickly learn all what was needed to perform as expected.  
At Qila, a company dedicated to Biogas, I had to learn all about the process of getting energy from Biogas and design of AD (Anaerobic Digestion) Plants, so I could provide the right support to operators and director.  
At Overview, a company dedicated to positioning drives, I had to understand the elctronic and software used on the drives they sell, so I could provide support to clients or internally about what the drives were capable to do.  
In both situations, I have been told good things about my performance and my flexibility in terms of learning new concepts.


### Team management

<!--Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)-->
