## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I am a full stack developer who is self-driven and a quick learner, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also continue my development as a software developer.

I studied Industrial Engineering in Spain, with specialisation in Production, but I have always had interest in programming. I started a Computer Science degree while working part-time in London for some time but I had to stop once I started working full time. I recently decided to give it my full time attention by joining Makers Academy, a 16 weeks software development bootcamp, so I could start my career path in Software.

Tech Skills:
- JavaScript (React, Node.js, Express, Jest, Cypress)
- Ruby (Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara) 
- Databases (MongoDB, SQL: PostgreSQL)
- HTML, CSS
- Heroku
- Git, GitHub

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

### Quick learner

During my working life, I have experienced several situations where this skill has been needed and beneficial. Even though my specialisation is in Production Engineer, I have joined 2 companies in London where my role had no relation with that and I had to quickly learn all what was needed to perform as expected.  
At Qila, a company dedicated to Biogas, I had to learn all about the process of getting energy from Biogas and design of AD (Anaerobic Digestion) Plants, so I could provide the right support to operators and my manager.  
At Overview, a company dedicated to positioning drives, I had to understand the electronic and software used on the drives they sell, so I could provide support to clients or internally about what the drives were capable to do.  
In both situations, I have received good feedback about my performance and my flexibility in terms of learning new concepts.
During the final project at Makers (last 2 weeks of the course), I learnt how to use React while creating the app. I had used JavaScript during the course, but I did not have any knowledge about that particular framework. The result was successful and my team could show a full stack application with several features implemented (please check project Palendar above for more information).


### Self-driven

When working at Overview, my role implied being in contact  with future and current clients who were using our products (or testing them) for a particular project. After a few months, my manager resigned and I became the only point of contact with clients for this purpose.  
Being a self-driven, self-motivated individual helped me during this process. Of course I needed some help sometimes from my colleagues in other teams but I wasn't afraid to ask so I could own the position and continue being the main point of contact with clients, as I was able to deliver what the company needed which resulted in my old manager's position never being replaced.

### Team player

Even though I am also used to work on my own, I believe in the importance of working in a team and have good communication with others.  
During my work experience in both Qila and Overview, I had to collaborate with other colleagues to achieve the right answers or outcomes. Also, before that, I worked in Marks and Spencer, initially as Team Member and then as Team Lead, where being able to work in a team was crucial. In both situations, I applied my skills successfully (for example, communicating effectively with my manager or other colleagues when being a Team Member or making sure everyone was heard when leading). 
During these last few months at Makers, we focussed on how Software teams are usually run and I was able to use my team player skills. We had pairing sessions everyday and got involved in engineering projects, where, as part of a small team (between 5 and 7 people), we had to develop a project. In these situations I contributed to achieving a good organization and good communication with each other, which I believe is very important when working in a team.

### Critical thinking

I have always used critical thinking within my education and work experience. For example, when I worked at Overview, I was in contact with clients resolving their queries about our products and I realised some of these questions were the same from time to time. I decided to create a register with these questions. The intention was to point out to some lack of information on the manuals we sent to customers or parts that could need a better explanation. This led to updates in the manuals which improved our relationship with clients.
